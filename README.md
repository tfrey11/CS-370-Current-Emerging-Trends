# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This projects goal was to implement deep Q-learning in an environment where an agent must navigate a maze to reach the goal at the end of the maze. I was given code for the environment that had the maze set up and any change, update, or observe functions for the environment itself. I was also given the code for the Expierence object for my algorithm, which dealt with storing, recalling, and calculating the Q-function. My task was to implement the learning process for the network to continue to progress the agent to become better and better at solving the maze with an end goal of having a 100% win rate.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist look at problems that are affecting humans in different ways and work to logically come up with solutions to the problem leveraging technology to find the most efficent solution to the problem.
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems as logically as possible. I work to divide complex problems into smaller less complex problems and systematically solve each smaller problem enabling me to come up with a systematic solution that is the most efficent solution to the problem.
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the orginazation?
My ethical responsibilities are to provide safe, efficent, working solutions for the betterment of the end user and the organization. This means that any solutions that I present must be secure and not endanger the user or company, they must not waste resources and get to the solution as wasteless as possible, and overall the solution must be a total working solution that meets the needs of both the end user and the orginization.
